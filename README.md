# barebones-react

This is a minimal set up using Browserify, the Babelify transform and React.

1. Pull repo and run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build` to run a one time build or `npm run start` to listen for changes.
3. Run `npm run serve` to start a static server

What about JSX? it just works.
What about ES6? Use it if you fancy. It just works.

Protips:   
* Use the [React Devtools Extension](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) for your [browser of choice](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
* Sublime users. [install this for plugin](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) for great JSX/ES6 support
